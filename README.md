## Goal
What is the good embedding of the nodes embedding?
Interaction are just exists or not, binarily dropping more semantic relational data, then what determined the nodes good embedding? In us lobby network, each actors without semantic relation considered, what determines the unique characteristic of their own? The node embedding should bundle those "unique" nodes' characteristic that might be disentangled and irrelevant from their interactions. We need to answer this question before starts on embedding.
